 The script asks you to create a new origin and a set of origin keys. Optionally, you can also provide a [GitHub personal authorization token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) to upload packages to the public depot and share them with the Habitat community. You can also provide anonymous data on your usage of the `hab` CLI. For information on the type of data we gather and how we intend to use it, see [Analytics in Habitat](/docs/about-analytics).
