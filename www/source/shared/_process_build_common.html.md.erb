The Habitat depot can contain multiple versions and releases of a given package. When you start a Habitat service, 
and depending on whether or not you specify a particular version number, Habitat will either pull the latest version, 
or the latest release for that particular version of the package.

A supervisor manages any application or service process within a Habitat service, so when a Habitat service starts 
up, the supervisor executes a command on the application software through a run script that was either generated by 
Habitat when the package was built (through the `pkg_binaries_run` setting), or through a run hook like in the case 
of mytutorialapp.

Services can currently be run in two ways: natively on a modern, 64-bit Linux distribution with the kernel version 
greater than 2.6.32, or in a supported external runtime format. Running services natively allows you to rapidly install 
and test your services on bare metal machines or VMs, but exporting your package into a different runtime 
format provides flexibility in where your packages run.
